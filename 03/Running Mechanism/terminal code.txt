How to Compile and Run the Programs on Windows
Compile the Sender and Receiver:

For the sender:
gcc sender.c -o sender -lws2_32

For the receiver:
gcc receiver.c -o receiver -lws2_32

The -lws2_32 flag links against the Winsock library, which is necessary for socket programming on Windows.

Run the Receiver:
Start the receiver program by specifying its own IP address and port.
./receiver 127.0.0.1 8080

Run the Sender:
Start the sender program by specifying the receiver's IP address and port.
./sender 127.0.0.1 8080
